# Account Security

### üç™ Cookie

#### What is a Cookie?

When you log in to Hoyolab, a "Cookie" file is created on your computer. This file allows you to access the website without entering your email and password again. The Cookie contains encrypted information about your account and serves as your identification. It saves you from logging in every time but poses security risks. If someone has your Cookie, they will be considered the owner of your account. Shenhe requires your Cookie to access exclusive features like Spiral Abyss and real-time notes. Therefore, linking your account to a Cookie is necessary.

#### Can I hack your account?

NO! Even though I have your Cookie, that doesn't mean I can do anything I want with your account.

1. I can't change your password because that requires confirmation with your email. I have no idea what your email address is, not to mention its password.
2. Two-factor authentication exists, which makes it completely impossible to steal your account if you have it set up.

### ‚úâÔ∏è Email and password

Normally, you obtain your Cookie by typing a javascript in the address bar.\
However, some users struggle with that approach.\
So Shenhe partners with the [Hutao Login Gateway Service](https://github.com/Hu-tao-bot/login-service-library-python) that allows you to obtain your account's Cookie with the method you are familiar with - Email and password.

#### What's going on here?

You enter your email and password -> complete the CAPTCHA test -> the HLGS will send an API request to Hoyoverse with your email and password encrypted -> Hoyoverse responds the request with your account's Cookie\
Neither me and [the author of HLGS](https://github.com/mrwan200) store your Hoyoverse email and password.\
We're just trying to get your account's Cookie, that's all.\
If you don't trust us, DON'T use this method. I personally strongly recommend you to use the script approach.\
Even if we attempt to login to Genshin Impact with your email and password, we still need an email verification from you. I have no idea what your email address is, not to mention its password.

### ü§ù Trust between you and me

I can do the following things, but I swear I won't do them:

1. Create community posts with your Hoyolab account
2. Share your Cookie with other people (But remember, nobody can hack your account with only the Cookie)

### ‚õî Can your account get banned?

1. There have been 0 record of Hoyoverse banning accounts for using their API (with Cookies)
2. Large Genshin Discord bots like Genshin Wizard have millions of users using the same API

### üõ°Ô∏è Is your data secure?

Your Cookie is stored in Shenhe's database, which locates on Amazon's AWS server.\
Amazon is a pretty huge company, that's all I can say.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Use at your own risk

Now that you have been informed of all the things above, it's still up to you to decide whether you want to link your account with Cookie or not.\
I will try my best to keep your account data secure, but I can't guarantee that something unexpected won't happen.\
Remember, I am not responsible for any account-related issues.\
Lastly, you can always remove your account data at any time you want using the /accounts command.\
Additionally, your Cookie will expire/become invalid once you change your account's password.
