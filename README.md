# Support Me
I developed Shenhe by myself (with 3rd party libraries and helps from other developers) in my free-time.  
Supporting is never an obligation but is always appreciated and motivates me to invest more time in the project and to keep this project alive.  
If you like my work, you can sponsor me on [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/seriaati).
